## Items Fixed and Added

Here are the fixes I made to closely resemble the mock set up for us.


1. Fixed header div into Header element.

2. Fixed broken links on one of the nav item.

3. Rearranged header tags from h2 -> h3, to now h1 -> h2 groupings.

4. Added additional padding to side content added and included a text-align center attribute for the divs to center the rest of the elements

5. Made font bigger and easier to read.

6. Added text shadow to all text elements.

7. Added alt to all images except for hero div content.
